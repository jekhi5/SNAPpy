# [SNAPpy](https://github.com/jekhi5/SNAPpy)
Access to good food shouldn't be hard.

## Description
SNAPpy works to counteract some of the difficulties that come with living in a food desert. Users are able to find [SNAP](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program)-accepting grocery stores in their area<sup><b>*</b></sup>, as well as important accessibility data for those stores like delivery, curbside pickup, and handicap accessibility information. Additionally, users can enter a shopping list and receive numerous recipes that can augment the nutritious value of their ingredients.

We designed this to be a light-weight web-app for numerous reasons. Our goal was to create an interface that could be accessible by people with any level of technology comfortability. We also recognized that our app could be used in places with low bandwidth (public libraries, low-coverage zones, etc.), and wanted to ensure a consistent user experience. As such, we used plain HTML, CSS, and JS in a Django environment.

We are hoping to include the following features in the future:
- Inventory information allowing the user to know if their desired items are available and in stock at specific grocery stores
- Permanent web-hosting
- Spanish/other language support
- Sponsorship/donation options to help offset API costs
- Much more!


<sup><b>*</b></sup>Currently this feature only works for locations in Massachusetts
